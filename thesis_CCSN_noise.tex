\chapter{The impact of terrestrial seismic noise on CCSN detectability and reconstruction}

\section{CCSN detectability in recolored non-Gaussian data}
Simple cWB runs on CCSN waveforms scaled to different distances (detection efficiency versus distance) 
\section{CCSN reconstruction in recolored non-Gaussian data}
Waveform reconstruction results for ONE method in Gaussian data versus S5 data recolored to aLIGO expected strain
